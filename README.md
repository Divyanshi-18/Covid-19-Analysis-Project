# Covid-19-Analysis-Project
This project involves hands-on data analysis of COVID-19 datasets using Python and Tableau. It aims to understand the impact of the pandemic by exploring various data points related to confirmed cases, recoveries, and vaccinations.
# 1. Objective
To analyze and visualize COVID-19 data using Python and Tableau. To engage users with interactive quiz questions throughout the tutorial.To provide insights into the progression and impact of COVID-19 globally and in India.
# 2. Data Collection
Three primary datasets are utilized in this project:
* COVID-19 India Data: Information on confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across various states in India.
* COVID-19 Vaccine Statewise Data: Details on vaccination statistics, including doses administered in different states.
* Global COVID-19 Data: Coverage of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for countries worldwide.
# 3. Python Project
The Python project utilizes the following libraries:
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy: For numerical computations.
* Matplotlib: For creating static data visualizations.
* Plotly: For interactive visualizations.
# 4. Key Tasks:
* Importing and cleaning datasets (e.g., dropping unnecessary columns).
* Analyzing trends in COVID-19 cases and vaccinations.
* Calculating active cases, recovery rates, and mortality rates.
* Visualizing findings through various plots such as bar charts, line plots, and pie charts.
# 5. Tableau Project
The Tableau project focuses on visualizing global COVID-19 data using Tableau's interactive dashboard capabilities. Various visualizations are created, including:
* A global map displaying active cases by country.
* Horizontal bar charts illustrating the top countries based on confirmed cases and deaths.
* Tree maps showing the distribution of deaths among countries.
* Dual-axis charts comparing recovery cases and deaths.
# 6. Conclusion
This project highlights the significance of data analysis and visualization in understanding public health issues, especially during a pandemic. It fosters practical skills in handling and interpreting real-world data using programming and data visualization tools.
